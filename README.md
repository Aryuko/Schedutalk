#About
This project is part of a school assignment at KTH (Royal Swedish Institution of Technology). The main goal of this project is to learn how to use github in projects and therefore we hope to maintain a good repo at github.

To do practice these qualities at github we first needed a project. So we decided to try something out of our previous experiences, thats why we wanted to create an app working for the biggest mobile OSes in Sweden. Android, iOS and Windows.
We chosen to work with the Xamarin framework for .NET

Moreover the project will be developed using Test Driven Developement and with the MVVM design pattern.

#Setting up the environment
APIs used for compiling the projects code was:
Xamarin 4.0.3.214
Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.6.01055
//We may have to clarify version of Android SDKs etc.
